This is the new official source code of the "TortoiseSVN Menu" Firefox extension which can be found here:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/tortoisesvn-menu/

Unfortunately someone has registered my old domain "PumaCode.org" and copied much of the old text but filled it with spam. Don't click anything there!

I don't maintain this extension any longer and don't even use Firefox much anymore but feel free to submit a pull request and if it looks reasonable I can include it.

LICENSE:
The TSVN Menu Extension is released under the GPL version 2. See LICENSE.txt.

TODO:
    * Figure out how to adjust menu based on whether file or directory
    * Figure out how to guess Subversion links?
